 Solr (pronounced "solar") is an open source enterprise search platform,
 written in Java, from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include
 full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing,
 dynamic clustering, database integration, NoSQL features and rich document
 (e.g., Word, PDF) handling. Providing distributed search and index
 replication, Solr is designed for scalability and fault tolerance.
